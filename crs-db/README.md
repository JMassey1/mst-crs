# PSQL Database (crs-db)

This folder is used to contain dumps of the development database as well as migration files. Initially, this folder is left empty.

## Migrations

Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time. They allow you to version your database schema and apply changes in a consistent and repeatable way.

## Database Dumps

Database dumps are used to backup and restore the database. They can be used to create a copy of the database for testing or to restore the database to a previous state.
